Hello,
if you want to publish a modified version of this pack
please credit me for the base pack. Same if you want to use my textures
in another pack. I have spent a quite lot of time on this pack (especially the
connected textures and the animations).

Mandatory credit links are:

The rest is your choice to include:

Now go play some Minecraft and hopefully enjoy this Resource Pack.

P.S: 
If you want your ideas to be added to the pack create an issue on the GitHub page
mentioned above.
